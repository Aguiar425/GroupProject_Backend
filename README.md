History
Blockbuster was once a leader in entertainment, but filed for bankruptcy in 2010 due to the rise of streaming services. Mind Swap Buster offers a unique concept that could bring back the communal spirit of Blockbuster by allowing users to swap minds and connect with others who share their interests. Mind Swap Buster has the potential to revive a Blockbuster-style service for a new generation.
